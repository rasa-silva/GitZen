# ZenHub

A minimalist GitHub client for Android written in Kotlin.

## Features:
 * OAuth via Android Account Manager
 * User overview
 * Own repository list with paging
 * Starred repository list with paging
 * Star/Unstar repo
 * Repo overview with README.md
 * Repo file browsing
 * Repo commits list with paging (only default branch for now)
 * Commit details including files diff
 

The source code is available on https://github.com/rasa-silva/ZenHub feel free to contribute/fork.


The feature set will target my own use/preferences and will not be a "fully featured" GitHub client.

Will not implement/merge:
  * Multiple users
  * Enterprise
  * Repo 
    * Statistics
    * Deployments
    * Invitations
  * Migrations
  * Others?
