# ZenHub

A minimal Android GitHub client for learning Android and polishing Kotlin skills.

The feature set will target my own use/preferences and will not be a complete GitHub client.

Contributions will gladly be accepted as long as:
  * Makes part of the feature set I want
  * Not being something I'd use, does not make a real difference in performance/complexity.
  
## Implemented:
 * OAuth via Android Account Manager
 * User overview
 * Own repository list with paging
 * Starred repository list with paging
 * Star/Unstar repo
 * Repo overview with README.md
 * Repo file browsing
 * Repo commits list with paging (only default branch for now)
 * Commit details including files diff
 

## Features that will *not* be implemented:
  * Multiple users
  * Enterprise
  * Repo 
    * Statistics
    * Deployments
    * Invitations
  * Migrations
