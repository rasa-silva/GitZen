# ZenHub

A minimal Android GitHub client for learning Android and polishing Kotlin skills.

The feature set will target my own use/preferences and will not be a complete GitHub client.

Contributions will gladly be accepted as long as:
  * Makes part of the feature set I want
  * Not being something I'd use, does not make a real difference in performance/complexity.

Features that will *not* be implemented:
  * Multiple users
  * Enterprise
  * Repo 
    * Statistics
    * Deployments
    * Invitations
  * Migrations
